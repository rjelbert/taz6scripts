# taz6scripts
Repo to store my Taz 6 related custom gcode scripts
These are for my personal reference purposes only and relate specifically to my Taz6 and custom OctoPrint setup
These will not work on your system without modification. Do not use unless you know how to edit gcode and inderstand how each command will impact your printer.
Never leave your printer unattended!
